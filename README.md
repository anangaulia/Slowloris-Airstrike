# Slowloris-Airstrike
 
Slowloris using spoofed ip. It waits 15 seconds and than BOOM, sends 100 packets from each of the 300 ips all at once.
 
Install:

sudo apt install hping3 -y && git clone https://github.com/The-Memzer/Slowloris-Airstrike.git && cd Slowloris-Airstrike && sudo pip3 install pyttsx3 && sudo python3 Slowloris-airstrike.py
  
Why it is better than other ddos tools:
 
Despite not using special bots or servers, this uses threading to completely push over the limits of your computer. It also uses spoofed ips so blocking one of them is useless, it has a cool voice and animation, and last it uses a slowloris tactic to amplify the attack by just a bit.
